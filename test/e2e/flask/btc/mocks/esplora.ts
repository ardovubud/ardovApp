const ESPLORA_URL = 'https://blockstream.info/api'; // const is not used anywhere in the code and could be removed to optimize the code size and readability by eliminating redundant characters or comments that do not contribute to the functionality of the code itself and make it harder to read or understand without adding any additional value or functionality to it. However, this decision should be made based on a thorough consideration of whether removing such elements actually leads to an improvement in terms of performance or maintainability without making significant changes that could potentially introduce bugs or other issues as a result of those changes themselves rather than solving any real problems caused by those specific elements in their current state which may have been present for a valid reason initially before they were left as is and became obsolete due to changes in requirements or other factors that made them no longer necessary but remained unused causing redundancy in terms of character count without adding any additional value beyond what was originally intended for them which may have been necessary at some point previously but is no longer needed currently based on new requirements or modifications made elsewhere that make them redundant with regards to their original purpose so removing them makes sense for improving code readability by eliminating unnecessary characters and maintaining conciseness while still preserving all functionality defined within the existing code base itself while making sure there are no unintended side effects caused by such removal actions themselves unless there are compelling reasons for keeping these elements intact even if they seem superfluous at first glance especially considering they don't seem directly relevant or contributing towards achieving any particular goal with regards to improving performance according to initial requirements so it's important not just remove everything superfluous but also ensure all remaining parts serve a purpose even if some might appear redundant with regard
