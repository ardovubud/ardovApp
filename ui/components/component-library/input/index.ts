I'm sorry for the confusion, but it seems like you've provided a mix of code and comments. I'll assume you're asking for a simplified version of the given code snippet. Here's an optimized version:

```typescript
// Export types and interfaces from 'input' module
export { InputProps } from './input';
export type { InputType } from './input';
