Okay, I need to optimize the given Jest snapshot code. Let me look at the original code. It's a React component using className attributes with long strings and a lot of whitespace.

First, I notice that each class name is written as a multi-line string with spaces and newlines. This isn't necessary and makes the code longer. I can condense these into single-line strings without breaking lines.

Also, there are extra spaces between attributes and their values. For example, `class="modal-content"` has unnecessary spaces around the equals sign. Removing these will make the code cleaner.

I should also remove redundant div wrapping because it's not needed for functionality or styling in this context.

So, I'll rewrite each className to be on one line without extra spaces around equals signs. Then, eliminate any unnecessary whitespace between elements to make everything more compact but still readable.
</think>

exports[`ModalContent Component should match snapshot 1`] = "<div><div class=\"modal-content\"><div class=\"modal-content__title\">Modal Title</div><div class=\"modal-content__description\">Modal Description</div></div></div>";
